During his undergraduate studies, he was active in student groups focused in developing computer games, mobile applications, and later as a developer for Cedro, a company specialized in solutions for the stock market.  
  
After graduation, Guilherme moved to Detroit, Michigan where he worked for Urban Science. As a consultant, he used his programming skills to process countless lines of information that helped justify decisions for major car manufacturers on projects in the Americas.
