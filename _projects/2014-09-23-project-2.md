## Overview
Having most of my skills towards programming and analysing agorithms, in this project I challenged myself into studying the dinamics behind the way quadcopters fly. By gathering knowledge on their mechanics and physics, my goal is to build a controller capable to maintain these type of drones in a steady flight, being as acurate as possible using mostly onboard sensors. At last, I will build a simulator script for the [Bitcraze Crazy Flie](http://www.bitcraze.se/crazyflie/) in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) (or Vrep) using my controller and use a real version of it for validation.

### State of the Art
In order to get a start point of how this models are build I read the following papers:  
* Comprehensive Simulation of Quadrotor UAVs Using ROS and Gazebo *by Johannes Meyer, Alexander Sendobry, Stefan Kohlbrecher, Uwe Klingauf and Oskar von Stryk 2*

* Full Control of a Quadrotor *by Samir Bouabdallah and Roland Siegwart*

* Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control
