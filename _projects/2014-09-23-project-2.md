# Intro
Coming from an undergrad in Computer Science and a work experience in developing and market studies I challenged myself in getting in the world of UAV's, by studying their dynamics, physics and control techniques. I believe that the collaboration between humans and UAV's in household or office spaces would be quite interesting. At this point, I do not expect drones to be helping us to carry burdensome loads of weight, the energy and aerodynamics for that is not easily available, or grasping complicated objects, after all that could be years of someone's PhD thesis in robot manipulation. 

Instead, what if I could initiate by using some SRLAM and Computer to transform my UAV into something like this:

![navi_following](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/navi_following.jpg?raw=true) ![navi_friend](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/navi_friend.jpg?raw=true)  
![navi_targeting](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/navi_targeting.jpg?raw=true) ![navi_hint](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/navi_hint.jpg?raw=true)  

In the series "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time" for N64 (by Nintendo - 1998), the fairy Navi assisted the protagonist Link on his quest to save a forsaken land by following him around, giving another view perspective, recognizing foes and friends or even giving useful advices.

Now, what if we could bring that to the real world? Let's change the fairy wings for rotors and we have a quadrotor, that could follow us around, stay in our house, office and assist us with our daily quests (which I hope is not vanquishing goblins and shadow creatures). What if my fairy based drone could monitor my apartment, recognizing the people there, film me spiking a volleyball from a nice angle, carry a letter to a co-worker whose desk is across the hall or even access the SIRI service from my iPhone and through a small on board speaker reminds me from my daily agenda (after seeing me goofing off on the couch). In some way this is not all new as there are companies doing something along these lines, still this is my motivation in working with UAV's. 
 
To achieving this idea is a long run, I will be performing a series of projects (that will probably go on even after my masters), focusing on the different areas that I judge appropriated to perform such tasks.    

## My Quadrotors

### [Crazy Flie](http://www.bitcraze.se/crazyflie/)
![Crazy_Flie](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/crazy_flie.JPG?raw=true)  
Weighing less than 20g and totally open source this nano quadrotor is a great startup for any quadrotor aficionado. Its parts are very cheap and it is so light that is harmless if collides to something.  

### [AR Parrot 2.0](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/)
![AR_parrot](https://github.com/guiklink/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/public/images/ar_parrot.JPG?raw=true)  
Due to its popularity, well documented SDK and lots of [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) packages available, I would say the that AR Parrot series is a good choice for those who wants to have a HD camera on board transmitting through wifi without having to build their own. In addition, the downwards camera provides an amazing stability algorithm in well illuminated ambient, what is perfect for indoor applications.


# 1 - Dynamics and Simulation

## Intro
When customizing quadcopters, by adding gadgets, increasing motors or changing its body shape, it is important to understand at a fundamental level their dynamics, in order to get the best performance of the controller that will be implemented. This project goal was to understand the physics of quadrotors and how that is applied in the ROS simulator "Hector Quadrotor" by  Johannes Meyer and Stefan Kohlbrecher, so it can be altered and used to simulate different kinds of flying drones and get an idea of how they will perform before actually building them.

## State of the Art
In order to get a start point of how this models are build I read the following papers:

* Comprehensive Simulation of Quadrotor UAVs Using ROS and Gazebo *by Johannes Meyer, Alexander Sendobry, Stefan Kohlbrecher, Uwe Klingauf and Oskar von Stryk 2*

* Full Control of a Quadrotor *by Samir Bouabdallah and Roland Siegwart*

* Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control
