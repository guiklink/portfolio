The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Apply pipeline on a video stream.
