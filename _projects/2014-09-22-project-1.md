## Overview
This project was an intro in using [ROS](http://www.ros.org/) and controlling a [Kuka youBot](http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/service_robotics/research_education/youbot/), a smaller and educational version of the Kuka robotic arms commonly used in industry and for medical purposes.

This was a group project and our goal was to make the youBot navigate to a small area, use tag recognition to locate blocks and pile them up in some simple constructions.

To clarify your goal see the the State Machine Diagram bellow. Or for full project description check the the [project web site](http://asbroad.github.io/me_495_final_project/).
