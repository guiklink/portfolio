# Introduction

My goal in this project is an improvement for toy helicopters by adding a better IMU, controllers and communication, the Cheap N' Tought Copter. Taking advantage of the low price of producing this helicopters and its robustness I can have lots of drones for testing flying applications and many units to try Swarm algorithms.
